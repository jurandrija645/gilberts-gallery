         * Think of this like a security guard that only lets certain people into a party.
         *
         * When someone wants to upload a file, their browser needs to know what kinds of
         * files are allowed (like images only) and how big they can be (like 4MB max).
         *
         * But we don't want to share ALL the secret party details (like where we store the files).
         * So this code only shares the basic rules, keeping the important stuff private!
